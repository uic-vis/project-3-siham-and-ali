        <p id="para-1">
            Selecting a school to send their young ones to is one of the most crucial 
            decisions in parents' lives. School life is an integral part of children's 
            lives and is vital for their academic and personal growth. While making 
            this decision, parents consider a variety of factors. These include:
        </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Academic Programs</li>
                <li>Quality of academic personnel</li>
                <li>Safety</li>
                <li>Extracurricular opportunities</li>
                <li>Location</li>
                <li>Cost</li>
            </ul>
        
        <p id="para-2">
            In light of the rise in school shootings in recent years
            <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where/2022/01">
            (on a 2022 study)</a>, we decided to evaluate schools in the City of Chicago School District 
            based on the crimes around these schools to assist parents in their 
            decision-making process.
