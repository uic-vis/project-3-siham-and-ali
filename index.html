        <p id="para-1">
            Selecting a school to send their young ones to is one of the most crucial 
            decisions in parents' lives. School life is an integral part of children's 
            lives and is vital for their academic and personal growth. While making 
            this decision, parents consider a variety of factors. These include:
        </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Academic Programs</li>
                <li>Quality of academic personnel</li>
                <li>Safety</li>
                <li>Extracurricular opportunities</li>
                <li>Location</li>
                <li>Cost</li>
            </ul>
        
        <p id="para-2">
            In light of the rise in school shootings in recent years
            <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where/2022/01">
            (on a 2022 study)</a>, we decided to evaluate schools in the City of Chicago School District 
            based on the crimes around these schools to assist parents in their 
            decision-making process.

                    what data needs to be displayed on the map. You can click on any community
                    you like to update the bar charts and develop insight.

                <li>
                    On the right, there is a bar chart which will display the
                    different types of crimes along with their count for the selected community.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There also exists a comparison chart. This chart will allow you to compare

            Finally Gun violence has resulted in loss of many lives and has left a devastating effect on the families
            of the victims. Looking at the crimes rates across the country, the government of United States launched
            the "Project Safe Neighbourhood (PSN)" initiative which brought together the law enforcement agencies at
            the federal, state, and local level and various researchers and community agencies to create strategic
            plans in the form of campaigns and school based programs.
        </p>

        <p id="para-2">
            The program, launched in 2001, is mainly targeted towards young gun offenders and ex-offenders in the 
            community to raise awarness about the repercussions and punishments associated with gun violence.

        <p id="para-3">
            In the city of Chicago, the PSN initiative has been launched in neighbourhoods with high gun violence
            with the aim to reduce gun violence.

        <p id="para-4">
            In this analysis, we aim to verify the success of the PSN initiative across the city of Chicago.,
