        <p id="para-1">
            Selecting a school to send their young ones to is one of the most crucial 
            decisions in parents' lives. School life is an integral part of children's 
            lives and is vital for their academic and personal growth. While making 
            this decision, parents consider a variety of factors. These include:
        </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Academic Programs</li>
                <li>Quality of academic personnel</li>
                <li>Safety</li>
                <li>Extracurricular opportunities</li>
                <li>Location</li>
                <li>Cost</li>
            </ul>
        
        <p id="para-2">
            In light of the rise in school shootings in recent years
            <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/school-shootings-this-year-how-many-and-where/2022/01">
            (on a 2022 study)</a>, we decided to evaluate schools in the City of Chicago School District 
            based on the crimes around these schools to assist parents in their 
            decision-making process.

            Let's explore the total variation of crimes across the communities of Chicago
            for the last 5 years (2017-2022).

                <li>
                    On the left, there is a map of the city of Chicago. On the top right corner
                    of the map exists a control panel. Using this control panel, you can choose
                    what data needs to be displayed on the map. You can click on any community
                    you like to update the bar charts and develop insight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    On the right, there is a bar chart which will display the
                    different types of crimes along with their count for the selected community.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There also exists a comparison chart. This chart will allow you to compare
                    communities that you previously selected with the current one.

            Now, that you have explored some communities and perhaps even created a list of

                <li>
                    Below these buttons, you will see yet another map of the city of chicago, however this time,
                    when you click on a community, the schools that are present in that community
                    along with the crime distribution will be shown on the map adjacent to it.
