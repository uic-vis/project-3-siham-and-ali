Steinmetz College Prep,\nlocated at 3030 North Mobile Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60634.\n \n \nDuring a comprehensive replacement of Locke’s\nroof, the structural engineer overseeing the renovation identified extensive\nconcrete deterioration following the removal of the masonry. The concrete\ndeterioration is structurally significant and potentially compromises the\ncapacity of the beam that supports the mansard roof framing of the second floor\nclassrooms of the west side of the school. The structural engineer determined\nthat relocating the west side second floor classrooms is appropriate and in the\nbest interest of student safety.\n \n On September 11, 2019, upon notification from\nthe structural engineer that the west side second floor classrooms would need\nto be evacuated, Locke administration relocated students to alternate locations\nwithin the school on a temporary basis.\n \n To ensure the continued safety of students and\nstaff, starting Monday, September 16, 2019, all 7th and 8th grade students will\nmove to an interim facility, Steinmetz College Prep, which is less than one\nmile from Locke Elementary School. It is expected that 7th and 8th grade\nstudents will return to Locke on January 6, 2020.  More information\nregarding this emergency relocation is detailed in the notice letter to parents\nand guardians of students.\n \n The district is unable to comply with applicable\nrequirements pursuant to 105 ILCS 5/34-200 through 5/34-235 due to the\nunexpected nature of this incident and imminent safety concerns.

The school was established in 2005. Located on the shores of Lake Michigan, in the diverse Uptown neighborhood, students have the ability to learn in an environment and high school unlike any other. Our beautiful facility and campus is located just blocks from Harry S. Truman College, one of the City Colleges of Chicago, where students can take college level courses during the school day. Students have the opportunity to request a modified class schedule that enables them to earn both high school and college credit simultaneously. In fact, through our Early STEAM program, students at Uplift can earn their associates degree or significant credit toward completion before ever graduating high school!  \n Our school was founded on the principles of social justice and we seek to produce graduates who are well informed and who have the ability to impact their communities, our city, our nation and ultimately the world for the greater good of humanity.
